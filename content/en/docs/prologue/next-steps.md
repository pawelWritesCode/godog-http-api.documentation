Until now, you should have at least basic understanding how to get your own copy of project and how to run pre-defined
tests shipped with it. 

Now, you should move to [Usage](/docs/usage/environment-variables/) section to understand how tests can be run in different ways.
Debugging is also explained there.

Next, see [Steps definitions](/docs/steps-definitions/creating-custom-steps/) to learn how to create your own
custom steps if needed and read pre-defined steps documentation.

Lastly, see [Utility services](/docs/utility-services/cache/). Treat it as appendix to mentioned above section. Utility services
will help you create your own custom steps with compatibility to already developed framework.
